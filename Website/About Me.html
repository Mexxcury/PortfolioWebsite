      <div class="text">
          <p>
            Masina is a Senior Advertising student at Temple University with a focus on brand strategy and research and a minor in Screen Studies.
            Originally from Los Angeles, California, she had early exposure to the film industry, 
            growing up at the Dick Clark Productions Screening Room and being integrated into Jamaican culture at a young age.
            She is very passionate about film for this reason, building an attuned sense to style and aesthetics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Masina believes that the future of media lies in the gaming industry, breaking standards and creating breathtaking content.
            She hopes to develop her work closely along digital trends and is always striving to understanding new technology.
            She hopes to work in social media marketing and digital media, but not excluding her fascination in research for consumer insights and UX design.
            Over time, deepening her knowledge in SEO content, she wishes to improve her skills in analytics to help build reports on media tactics.
            But she is not afraid to tap into her creative side, either through the development of intersting strategy, creating short-form media in Premiere Pro, or even through web development.
          <p>
            Beyond her background in the film industry, she would love to be a part of TV News production, having an early interset in editorial and news.
            She finds that being on the edge of current events and informing the public of necessary information is a necessity in society, and would love to be a part of that cause.
            She is a constant writer, and is hoping to develop her skills through editorial, public relations, or in production.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if it felt like her ambition ended there, she hopes to travel around the world, having already gone to Rome, Italy as a study abroad program in Summer 2023.
            Some of the major european cities she has already traveled to is Barcelona, Nice, Palermo, Venice, and Florence.
            Wanting to expand her international knowledge, and her growing understanding of various cultures around the world, she knows it will only help deepen her perspective into her advertising experience.
